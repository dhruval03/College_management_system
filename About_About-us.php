                        <p>Lukhdhirji Engineering College was established as a Technical Institute in 1931, then known as Morvi Technical Institute (MTI) and was upgraded to a full-fledged polytechnic and degree engineering college. In 1951 the Late Honorable H.H. Maharaja Thakore Shri Sir Lukhdhirji Waghji Sahib of Morvi state donated his palace with 40 acres (160,000 m2) of land on the bank of river Machhu so the institute was named after him.In 1951 The Late Honorable H.H. Maharaja Thakore Shri Sir Lukhdhirji Waghji Sahib Bahadur GBE KCSI of Morvi met Professor Sunder Singh Bhatia from the Dayalbagh Educational Institute and asked him to upgrade the Morvi Technical Institute (MTI) to a full-fledged degree engineering college and become its first principal. The Maharaja had four palaces. The Nazarbag palace was donated to become what is now the Engineering College. Another two palaces became student accommodation and the principal's private residence respectively. The fourth palace was retained by the Maharaja as his personal residence.</p>
