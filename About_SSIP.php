                        <h1>Student Startup & Innovation Policy</h1>
                        <p>SSIP stands for Student Startup and Innovation Policy. This Policy was launched by the
                            Education Department, Government of Gujarat in 2017 (for 2017-2022). The objective of SSIP
                            is to ignite the students to become entrepreneurs. Students should be encouraged to become
                            job providers rather than job seekers. Through SSIP policy, students will be provided
                            funding (through their college) to realize their startup. The Policy Document, declared by
                            the government, has been attached herewith.
                            To provide benefits of this policy to the students of our college, at Lukhdhirji Engineering
                            College (Diploma) a team SSIP has been formed. This team SSIP consists of faculty members
                            from various departments. The details of the members of this Team SSIP of our College is as
                            under.
